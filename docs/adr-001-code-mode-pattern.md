# ADR-001: Code Mode Pattern for Clever Cloud MCP Server

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need an MCP server that gives LLM agents access to the full Clever Cloud API (~177 commands across 43 categories). The traditional approach of exposing one MCP tool per API endpoint would create 177+ tool definitions, consuming tens of thousands of tokens in every LLM context window just for tool descriptions.

Cloudflare pioneered a "Code Mode" approach for their MCP server: instead of many tools, expose just two (`search` + `execute`) that let the LLM discover API endpoints and compose calls by writing code. This reduced their context usage by 99.9%.

However, Cloudflare's implementation relies on processing a raw OpenAPI specification and running code in sandboxed Cloudflare Workers. Our situation differs: we have `@clevercloud/client`, a strongly-typed TypeScript client with a command pattern, and we run locally on the user's machine.

## Decisions

### 1. Two-tool Code Mode architecture

**Decision**: Expose exactly two MCP tools — `search` and `execute`.

- `search`: text-based filtering over a static command catalog
- `execute`: runs JavaScript code with a pre-authenticated `CcApiClient` and all command classes in scope

**Rationale**: ~177 commands at ~100 tokens each = ~17,000 tokens per context. Two tools with concise descriptions use ~500 tokens total. The LLM discovers what it needs on demand via `search`.

### 2. Use `@clevercloud/client` commands directly (no OpenAPI spec processing)

**Decision**: The execute tool exposes the client's command classes (`ListApplicationCommand`, `CreateDomainCommand`, etc.) rather than raw REST calls.

**Rationale**: The command classes provide:
- Automatic `ownerId` resolution from `applicationId`/`addonId`
- Response transformation and error mapping
- Typed parameters (surfaced in the catalog for the LLM)
- No need to download, parse, resolve `$ref`s, and pre-process an OpenAPI spec

This is a key advantage over Cloudflare's approach, which must maintain an OpenAPI spec processor and cron job.

### 3. No sandbox / no Worker isolation

**Decision**: Execute user-provided code via `new AsyncFunction(...)` directly in the Node.js process.

**Rationale**: The MCP server runs locally on the user's machine as a stdio process. The user (or their LLM agent) already has full system access — they can run shell commands, edit files, etc. Sandboxing the API calls adds complexity without meaningful security benefit. The threat model is identical to any other MCP tool.

A configurable timeout via `AbortSignal.timeout()` (`CC_MCP_TIMEOUT_MS`, default 30s) protects against runaway execution and cancels in-flight network requests.

### 4. API Token authentication only

**Decision**: Support only `api-token` authentication, not OAuth v1.

**Rationale**: OAuth v1 PLAINTEXT requires a multi-step browser flow with consumer key/secret exchange. This is incompatible with a headless MCP server invoked by a CLI tool. API tokens are:
- Simple to create (one step in the Clever Cloud console)
- Long-lived and scopable
- Passed via a single environment variable

### 5. Static command catalog generated at build time

**Decision**: A build script introspects `@clevercloud/client` to generate a JSON catalog and a TypeScript command registry. Both are committed to git.

**Rationale**:
- No runtime introspection or dynamic import overhead
- The catalog format is optimized for the `search` tool (class name, category, params, description)
- Regenerated only when upgrading `@clevercloud/client`
- The command registry uses static imports for fast startup and TypeScript verification

### 6. Eager command class loading

**Decision**: All ~177 command classes are statically imported at startup into a flat `Record<string, CommandClass>`.

**Rationale**: The MCP server is a long-running process. Loading all commands at startup (< 50ms) avoids per-call dynamic import latency. The LLM accesses commands as `commands.ListApplicationCommand` — a direct, unambiguous mapping from search results to executable code.

## Consequences

- LLM agents can access the full Clever Cloud API surface with minimal token overhead
- Adding new commands requires regenerating the catalog (`npm run generate-catalog`)
- No type safety on LLM-generated code (errors are caught at runtime and returned to the LLM)
- The `AbortSignal` timeout cancels in-flight requests, but CPU-bound infinite loops are not interruptible in a single-threaded Node.js process
- No multi-tenant safety — this is a single-user, local-execution tool by design
